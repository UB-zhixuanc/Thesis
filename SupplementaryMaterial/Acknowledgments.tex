% Place acknowledgments below.
I would like to express sincere gratitude to my thesis advisor, Professor Abani K. Patra, for his
guidance, encouragement, and constant proposal of challenging new ideas. I am also grateful
to him for his continuous support and the opportunities I had during my thesis work to attend international meetings and conferences and interact with other researchers from all over the world.
I also express my appreciation to all the other members of my supervisory committee, Professor E. Bruce Pitman, Professor Marcus Bursik, and Professor Paul Bauman. In particular, the advice
and the encouragement of Professor E. Bruce Pitman has been of great help in my work on model establishment, developing and implementing the new SPH schemes GSPH and RSPH. Discussions with Professor Marcus Bursik regarding the necessity of my research topic, the volcanic model simplification and potential implementations of the model are greatly helpful and appreciated. He also gave me hands on session for using HYSPLIT and provided me data for model validation. Advice and encouragement from Professor Bauman are also helpful and greatly appreciated.

I am grateful to collaborators and other students of Professor Patra as well. Particularly, Dr. Jones, helped me in many technique issues that I had while developing Plume-SPH and implementing it for ash transportation and dispersion. I always got patient and professional response from him even for small techniques questions. Great appreciation goes to him. Advice and help from Dinesh, Ramona and Hossein made it easier for me to get start in the lab. I have been discussing and shearing knowledge with Ali, Prashant, Qingyuan Yang, Abishek and Renette, which was great learning experience and helpful to my research. 
 
Finally, I express my deep gratitude to my family for their solid support.
